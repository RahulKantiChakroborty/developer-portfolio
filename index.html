            <h3>Fathers, like mothers, are pillars in the development of a child's emotional well-being.</h3>
            <p>Children look to their fathers to lay down the rules and enforce them. They also look to their fathers to
                provide a feeling of security, both physical and emotional.</p>

            <p>
                The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals,
                including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and
                JavaScript.

                <p>My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain a
                    commercial piece of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that
                    software is generating money for someone somewhere even indirectly, then the developer who made it
                    is
                    professional.</p>

                <p>A Junior Developer is a basic level software developer or programmer who works in a development team.
                    They are in charge of helping the team with all the coding and software design tasks. To make it
                    simple,
                    we can say that a Junior Developer writes and maintains the code of computer applications.</p>
